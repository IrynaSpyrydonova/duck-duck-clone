## Welcome to the Clone of DuckDuckGo!

This is a reproduction of the website [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), which is done in the framework of the school [HackYourFutureBelgium](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/home).

We split the parts of the website and exclusively re-produced it via HTML and CSS.
Moreover, in the [development strategy](https://github.com/IrynaSpyrydonova/duck-duck-clone/blob/master/development-strategy.md) you might enjoy every step, how the product is brought up to you as a user.
